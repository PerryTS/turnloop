//! One worker per direction of an adopted synchronous handle. Requests retain their caller
//! buffers until the worker's completion packet; cancellation joins buffer access.
//!
//! Windows serializes every I/O request on a synchronous file object: an idle ReadFile
//! holds the object's I/O lock inside the kernel, so WriteFile (and control I/O such as
//! GetConsoleMode) on the same object waits until the read completes. Both workers use
//! one object, so for synchronous pipes the write worker preempts an idle read with
//! CancelSynchronousIo before writing. A cancelled pipe read has consumed no bytes (named
//! pipe reads complete only with data), and the read worker reissues the same request
//! after the write, so read FIFO order and exactly-once completion are unchanged. A write
//! that waits for the peer to drain its buffer still holds the lock; reads on that
//! endpoint queue behind it until it completes or is cancelled. libuv's non-overlapped
//! pipes have the same kernel constraint (see `uv_pipe_getsockname` in pipe.c).
