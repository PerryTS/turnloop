//! Internal platform contract, revision 2 (empty-wait instrumentation and native services).
//!
//! Public only so the contract runner and independently developed backends can use
//! it; not a stable end-user extension API. All identifiers and buffers are core
//! types. No raw fd, OVERLAPPED pointer, pollable or browser object crosses here,
//! with one deliberate exception: `raw_transport` reports a `RawTransport` the core
//! passes straight through to the host and never acts on (§5a handle transfer).
//! Ownership still leaves through `detach`/`Detached`, never through that value.
//!
//! # Ownership and completion rules (D1–D4)
//!
//! * `open`/`attach` bind a resource to the supplied generational Handle. On error
//!   they retain nothing. Open::Tcp creates an unconnected resource; the Connect
//!   request performs the connection. Once validated/accepted, even a synchronous
//!   I/O error is queued as a terminal Event. Submit errors reject before acceptance
//!   (unsupported/invalid operation, capacity/resource setup failure).
//!   `submit` accepts ownership of a Request only on Ok; on
//!   Err it must have stopped all access to its buffers before returning.
//! * Every accepted Request yields one terminal Event, including cancellation and
//!   errors. Multishot accepts/reads may yield preceding nonterminal Events. Their
//!   terminal Event acknowledges that buffers and native op storage are quiescent.
//! * Native completions carry the **full OpId**, never a token or a reusable index
//!   alone. Delayed kernel events must not complete a later generation. IOCP must
//!   keep OVERLAPPED storage pinned until the final kernel acknowledgement.
//! * `cancel` initiates cancellation, never frees native buffers prematurely. It
//!   must eventually emit a terminal event even when cancel races with success.
//!   The core arbitrates the result and emits Cancelled if cancellation won.
//! * `prepare_close` starts nonblocking teardown before cancellation. Process
//!   backends terminate the owned child and retain its exit operation until reaped,
//!   including when cancellation is already pending. Other resources need no hook.
//! * The core calls `release` only after every associated operation terminated
//!   and the Closed completion was appended to host output. Drop must synchronously
//!   quiesce any remaining I/O before freeing buffers (native completion draining
//!   may be necessary). The driver never invokes user callbacks.
//!
//! # Turn and boundedness (D5–D7)
//!
//! * `poll` appends at most `events.capacity() - events.len()` Events; never grows
//!   the vector. A full buffer retains work for the next turn, without losing an
//!   edge. At most one OS wait is allowed (DESIGN §10 rule 3). Queued work
//!   prohibits blocking waits: the driver passes a zero timeout, and calls poll
//!   for that one discovery poll only with native operations pending and native
//!   output reserve. With no native operation pending, the driver skips poll for
//!   queued work, whatever `has_work` reports (web, whose poll never
//!   enters the OS, keeps draining cached host work). `None` means an unbounded
//!   wait. Durations must retain sub-millisecond precision.
//! * Readiness backends execute I/O in poll, cache readiness until EAGAIN, and
//!   requeue partially processed work fairly. Completion backends drain native
//!   completions. WASI 0.2 polls pollables; 0.3 drives a waitable set; web drains
//!   callback results and rejects blocking waits on the main thread.
//! * EINTR ends this poll early; it must not restart the timeout. `PollInfo.waits`
//!   counts positive-timeout/infinite waits; `discovery_polls` counts zero-time
//!   native polls. Their sum is at most one. `zero_event_waits`
//!   counts raw empty calls across both counters, including EINTR.
//!   Private timeout events count as zero-event waits, just like a timed OS wait
//!   returning zero; never infer this from user completions. Every backend that
//!   implements its timeout with a private wakeup source normalizes it: epoll's
//!   timerfd, the IOCP deadline packet, the WASI 0.2 deadline pollable and the
//!   WASI 0.3 deadline subtask. Real I/O or notifier events arriving in the same
//!   call still make it non-empty.
//! * Cached readiness ending in EAGAIN with no completion must retain the original
//!   timeout for the one permitted OS wait. It must not force a zero-timeout turn.
//! * `has_work` covers queued completions and cached runnable I/O. `wake` is called
//!   only after the notifier observed PARKED. It must be safe after loop drop:
//!   the wake object owns its native resource or detects closure, never uses a
//!   possibly reused raw handle. Errors cannot silently lose a wake.
//! * `integration` opts into external waiting. The core then leaves its notifier
//!   PARKED between turns; hosts call it again only while preparing external waits.
//!   This reconciles a readable integration fd with zero syscalls while RUNNING.
//!
//! # Transfer and platform constraints (§5a, §7)
//!
//! * `detach` is called only when all operations are quiescent. It unregisters the
//!   source loop before returning an owning Send transport. `attach` re-registers
//!   on the destination. Unsupported resources return Unsupported. For asynchronous
//!   cancellation, public detach can return WouldBlock while cancellation drains;
//!   the caller turns the source loop and retries. No blocking wait is hidden here.
//! * `Detached` may be an enum, not an integer: IOCP socket migration may require
//!   duplication; WASI/browser objects need not support transfer. `Resource` is
//!   intentionally absent: each backend owns its native tables keyed by Handle.
//! * A `Detached` is also how a descriptor leaves turnloop for good: the platform
//!   types expose `into_fd`/`into_socket`/`into_handle`, which restore whatever
//!   the backend changed on adoption (status flags, terminal or console mode) and
//!   then release ownership. Because `detach` already proved quiescence, the loop
//!   has no operation, buffer or registration left for that transport.
//! * `Wake` is Send + Sync on every target, but single-thread WASI/web may implement
//!   it as a flag/host scheduler token. No backend creates a loop-driving thread.
//!   Windows' explicitly requested Integration::Event helper is the D7 exception.
//! * Unsupported platforms/capabilities return errors; no fake successful I/O.
//!
//! # Socket options (§7.7)
//!
//! * `set_option`/`get_option` are synchronous and produce no Event. They run
//!   entirely inside the call, touch no operation storage, and must not allocate.
//! * A backend reports `Unsupported` for an option its platform lacks. It must
//!   never accept and ignore one: a host reads a lie back from `get_option`, and
//!   "the option is on" is a security- and latency-relevant claim.
//! * `ListenOpts::accept_defaults` is applied by the accepting backend to each
//!   accepted transport before its `Accepted`/`PipeAccepted` Outcome is produced,
//!   so the core hands the host an already-configured connection. A backend that
//!   cannot apply a requested default rejects the listener in `open`.
//!
//! # Filesystem (§7.6 Files)
//!
//! * `FILESYSTEM` selects where typed `FsRequest`s run. `Pool` (native default):
//!   the core runs them on the shared blocking pool and never calls the backend.
//!   `Backend` (WASI): `fs` accepts them under the ordinary Request rules, with a
//!   FIFO per handle, and yields `Outcome::Fs`. A request that opens binds its
//!   native object to the supplied new handle only on success; after a failed or
//!   cancelled open the core calls `release` for that never-visible handle.
//! * `fs_watch` binds a native watch to a new handle; the core then submits one
//!   multishot `Operation::WatchFs`. Each nonterminal `Outcome::Watch` carries a
//!   pooled lease of records (see `WatchEvents`). Pool exhaustion retains events
//!   in bounded per-watch storage; lost events set `overflow`. No backend thread
//!   is created: native watch sources are registered with the loop's own wait,
//!   except where the OS delivers on its own threads (FSEvents dispatch queues).
