//! Typed filesystem requests, native watches and their portable byte records.
//!
//! * **Native** (Linux, macOS/BSD, Windows): every request runs on the shared
//!   bounded blocking pool (DESIGN D8). Operations on one file or directory handle
//!   run in submission order; independent path requests may complete in any order.
//!   Adopted descriptors (`Detached::from_fd`/`from_handle`, stdio) keep their stream
//!   paths: reusable pool jobs on Unix, one synchronous worker per handle on Windows.
//! * **WASI 0.2/0.3**: the same requests map onto `wasi:filesystem`, resolved only
//!   against preopened directories. There is no ambient path authority.
//! * **Web**: Unsupported. No OPFS host mapping is defined.
//!
//! Every accepted request completes exactly once with `OpResult::Fs`, `Err`,
//! or `Cancelled`. A request that has started on a pool thread runs to its end;
//! cancellation then reports `Cancelled` and discards its result. Buffers follow
//! the D3 contract: provided memory is accessed only until the terminal completion.
